# KASPA
KASPA, a simple python assistant. 
This is a refactoring of an assistant for a raspberry pi that I had developed some months ago. It is still a work in progess, the code of some modules.
The goal of this project is to develop an assistant that works as simple as possible, while offering all options one could want from a personal assistant.
During development I focused on keeping the code simple and making it easy to extend the functionality. 

## Communicators
Communicators are a way to communicate with the core of KASPA. So far I created a telegram bot, a voice communicator and a simple cli. 
However I have only tested the cli after refactoring the project
 
## Modules
To create a new module for KASPA, simply create a new class that inherits from the abstractModule.
In this class a list of regular expressions should be defined that will trigger the module. 
Furthermore KASPA expects a module name. The action method gets called, when the called query matches a regular expression from the list.
This is where the magic of the module happens. For more details check the documentation in the code.

## Dependencies
This section will be added, once a release version gets pushed.
